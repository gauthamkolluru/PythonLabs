Adding values too strings dynamically => during runtime by using format() and interpolation.

## format()

. . .

1. without using Indexes

Ex: '{} is {} Text'.format('This', 'some')

. . .

2. Using Indexes

Ex: '{1} is {0} Text'.format('some', 'This')

## Interpolation

Introduced with Python 3.6. and is very convenient

Ex: name = 'Python'

f"The name of the student is {name}"
