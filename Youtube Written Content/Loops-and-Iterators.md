## While

. . .

How does 'while' work?

. . .

It says to the Python Engine to execute / run the following statement(s) as long as the condition, given along with the 'while' holds True

----

Ex:

1. WAP to print all positive digits => 1 to 9

. . .

2. Do the same task as in previous program but with a different condition (using True)

## For an Iterator

. . .

It works much like drawing one ball at a time from a bag of balls. (In some languages, a similar thing is referred to as a 'for each' construct)

. . .

Ex:

1. WAP to print all positive digits

. . .

2. WAP to retrieve one character at a time from a given string
