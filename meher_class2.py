# Datastucture: structure of Data

# problem statement:

# 1. list of items with quatities
# 2. rate

# Built-in Datastructures in C: Arrays, Structures, Pointers, Char

# List - similar to arrays, but can contain different Types of data - modifiable
# List - a collection of heterogenous data that is dynamic in nature!


#Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100

a = list(range(2,101,2))

for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i])
